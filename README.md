## Overview
BitMeme is a mobile app that empowers users to create hilarious, viral-ready memes using AI, and instantly tip their favorite memes with Bitcoin. BitMeme combines OpenAI's advanced language generation, the [memegen.link](https://memegen.link) API for meme image rendering, and mints memes as NFTs on the STX blockchain. The app supports Bitcoin, Solana, and STX for seamless micropayments and tipping.

---

## The Problem
Memes are the language of the internet, but meme creators rarely get rewarded for their creativity. Current meme platforms lack true ownership, transparent monetization, and direct peer-to-peer tipping using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. There is no easy way to create, share, and monetize memes in a decentralized, user-friendly way.

---

## The Solution
BitMeme solves these problems by:
- **AI-Powered Meme Creation:** Users describe their meme idea, and BitMeme uses OpenAI (gpt-4-turbo) to select the best meme template and generate witty captions.
- **Instant Meme Rendering:** Memes are rendered in real-time using [memegen.link](https://api.memegen.link/images) and minted as NFTs on STX.
- **Bitcoin & Crypto Tipping:** Instantly tip your favorite memes using Bitcoin, Solana, or STX with a seamless in-app wallet.
- **On-Chain Provenance:** Every meme's history, ownership, and creator are verifiable on-chain.
- **Mobile-First Social Experience:** View, share, and remix memes in a fun, viral feed.

---

## Key Features
- **Describe Your Meme:** Enter a prompt describing your meme idea (e.g., "when your code finally compiles").
- **AI-Powered Creation:** BitMeme uses OpenAI (gpt-4-turbo) to select the best meme template and generate captions.
- **Instant Rendering:** Memes are rendered in real-time and minted as STX NFTs.
- **Meme Feed & Sharing:** Instantly see your most recently generated meme and share or remix it.
- **Regenerate:** Not satisfied? Tap "Generate Again" to remix your prompt.
- **Bitcoin Tipping:** Each meme features a "❤️" button for instant tipping with your coin of choice.
- **Seamless Payments:** Use the in-app wallet for fast, easy payments.
- **Instant Feedback:** Get notified when your tip is successful.

---

## Why BitMeme Stands Out
- **First AI-Powered Meme Generator with Bitcoin Tipping:** Most meme platforms are centralized and lack crypto-native features. BitMeme is Bitcoin-first and AI-driven.
- **Empowers Creators:** Direct, transparent monetization for meme artists via tips and NFT minting.
- **Viral by Design:** Social features and remixing drive engagement and value.
- **Open & Extensible:** Built with open APIs and standards for future integrations.
- **Beginner Friendly:** Simple onboarding, no crypto jargon, and fun UX.

---

## Hackathon Fit & Prize Tracks
- **Main Competition:** BitMeme is a novel, open-ended Bitcoin application.
- **Best Use of sBTC:** (If implemented) Programmable meme trading on Stacks.
- **Best Design:** Focus on viral, accessible, and delightful UX.
- **Most Educational:** Promotes Bitcoin adoption through meme culture.
- **Quirkiest Hack:** Memes + Bitcoin + AI = Internet magic.
